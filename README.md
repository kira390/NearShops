# NearShops
This project is [The Web Coding Challenge](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/web-coding-challenge/blob/master/README.md) proposed Hidden Founders as part of their hiring process.
More infos on the guidelines are [here](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/web-coding-challenge/blob/master/coding-challenge.md)

## Objectives
My objectives here are to build the Backend endpoints for an app that lists shops nearby.
The features i aim in this projet are:
* Handling the user Sign up/Sign in processes
Signed in users can:
* Retrieve nearby shops (Sorted by distance).
* Like shops (liked shops won't appear in the nearby shops).
* Retrieve the liked shops list.
* Remove a shops from his liked shops list
* Dislike shops (disliked shops won't appear in the nearby shops for 2 hours).
For a deeper insight of the NearShop Architecture check [the Architecture doc](docs/Architecture.md)
